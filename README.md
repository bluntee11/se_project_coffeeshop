# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Change the recipes section to home-brewing tips & tricks section with more videos to choose from
- Create a blog section under the recipe section to list actual recipes with photos and have a new one feautured each week
- In the about section add customer reviews & photos
- List a phone number in the footer section with the social links (not everyone wants to or uses social media to contact businesses, creates an accessibilty issue)
- Makes the site more interactive with the shapes it uses already, possibly add some animated coffee beans or cups
